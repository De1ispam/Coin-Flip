This is a simple coin flip game created as a way to scale down my Odin Project RPS program to smaller parts for easier coding and debugging.

I found benefit to it as one of the core components to problem solving is stripping down the problem to smaller parts. 

I found this a good exercise because it allowed me to build a similar program twice. 

I imagine it can also be a bonus project for front end dev experiences and itâ€™s easily customizable. 


Anticipated additions will include:

-A scoreboard on  the main page
-Being able to follow  the game directly from the page instead of the consol
-Style/Design
